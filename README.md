# Nazdik

## Introduction

Nazdik is a proximity detection system that utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to determine the distance of objects nearby. Upon detecting items within a pre-set range,
it activates a series of LEDs as a visual alert. This system is implemented on a Raspberry Pi platform, leveraging its GPIO capabilities for sensor interfacing and LED control,
providing a responsive and interactive warning mechanism
